I am a programmer and mathematician based in Rochester, New York.
<br><br>
  As of today I am most comfortable in C++, Python, and C#. 
    I also have some experience in Bash, JS, and SQL.
    Mathematically, I am comfortable with subjects such as and similar to Linear Algebra, Calculus, and Discrete Math.
    In my free time I rotate between self studying Topology, Abstract Algebra, and Category Theory (it's healthy to keep up).
    <br><br>
    I have one and a half year of experience in developing software for numerous employers and I am looking for an
  great environment which has great people.
