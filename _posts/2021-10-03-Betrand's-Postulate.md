Here's a presentation I did on Bertrand's Postulate. These are just the slides, so if you try to go through it alone it might be a little difficult. I tried to make this as clear as possible though. Most of my slides are me explaining the statements Erdős claimed.

I had a really fun time with this proof. I still can't believe Erdős came up with it when he was 20! I remember spending numerous hours bashing my head against the wall trying to figure this out. I think a part of this is because I've never really read a proof that isn't some cookie cutter example of a proof technique. Most proofs that I have ran into in college were no longer than a page and were built almost strictly on already known theorems. 
<br><br>

I think the reason why this was so hard is because Erdős just /says/ things that are true. Then somehow, all this seemingly random information about the middle binomial coefficient and the prime factorizations comes along to show that some random inequality creates a contradiction... but not even an immediate contradiction. If you see in the slides, n has to be greater than 468 for it to happen.<br><br>

At the end of the day, this logically makes sense. But I have a hard time understanding *how* Erdős thought to glue these facts together to create this proof. I have also heard other people consider this to be one of the better proofs that they have read. It's also even a proof in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proofs_from_THE_BOOK">THE BOOK</a>. <br><br>
