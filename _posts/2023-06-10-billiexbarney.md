This morning I stumbled across a video of Billie Eilish doing a cover of "In the Mood for Love".
It was great although I couldn't stop hearing Barney Kessel's playing over it. He was the guitarist on Julie London's "Julie Is Her Name".

So, I decided to make my own version by using AI to isolate Billie's vox, and then to isolate Barney and Ray(bass). I then merged the two by hand. There wasn't *too* much work I had to do. Billie seemed to be singing pretty close to how Julie recorded it in terms of time, but I did do some editing to make it make sense.

Anyways, here it is:\

I also generated the cover art by using some stable diffusion checkpoint
