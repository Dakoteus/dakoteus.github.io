A property of a system is said to be emergent if it is a new outcome of some other properties of the system and their interaction, while it is itself different from them.

Recently, life has lead me to question how certain complicated things work. Such as governments, economies, businesses, relationships, friendships, general behavior in organisms, etc...

Some other quick examples are evolution, cooperation, crystalic structures, etc... its really in everything. But the real situation is when systems emerge.

I often wonder how much of my life exactly is due to emergence, and if its even useful to think of it that way. How much pain is caused from it? How much time, work, and money is waisted because of these horrible systems we find ourselves in and unable to escape from? The systems which not only serve us immediate pain, but leave us to question how much worse they can get. How did they emerge? Why did they emerge?  

*What will emerge?*

There is this wiki article on "Systems Theory" being the "interdisciplinary study of systems". But I feel like its one of those things that is so vague and general that its hard to say anything useful about the world with. Labeling things is definitely good though.

I often times feel like I get more use out of reading about something specific like game theory, information theory, chaos theory, signals, or just mathematics in general. I also feel like this is what most people in power do... Like any govts use of mathematics in their numerous large departments. They're one of the 'organisms' that hires the most mathematicians, and its surely not for no reason. Thats not even counting the companies and other organisms that they puppet... or puppet them...

I always wonder why people give so much of their power to an organism who's philosophy is secret or unknown to its labor force. Especially after Snowden, Wikileaks, + every other embarrassing event. How do you justify it? Copium? Are you groomed? Or is it the escape from your self?

This isn't necessarily a hit at the govt & company... Other people have different pieces of information, different interpretations of the world, and everyone is susceptible to brainwash... even me :D

Anyways, just sharing quick thoughts here. Have a good day.
  
"O plunge your hands in water,  
&emsp;Plunge them up to the wrist;  
Stare, stare into the basin  
&emsp; And wonder what you've missed.
  
O look, look in the mirror,  
&emsp;O look in your distress:  
Life remains a blessing  
&emsp;Although you cannot bless.
  
O stand, stand at the window  
&emsp;As the tears scald and start;  
You shall love your crooked neighbour  
&emsp;With your crooked heart."
