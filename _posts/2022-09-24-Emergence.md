A property of a system is said to be emergent if it is a new outcome of some other properties of the system and their interaction, while it is itself different from them.

Recently, life has lead me to question how certain complicated things work. Such as governments, economies, businesses, relationships, friendships, general behavior in organisms, etc...

Some quick examples are evolution, cooperation, other social behavior, crystallic structures, etc... its really in everything.

I often wonder how much of my life exactly is due to emergence, and if its even useful to think of it that way. How much pain is caused from it? How much time, work, and money is waisted because of these horrible systems we find ourselves unable to escape from? From the systems which not only serve us immediate pain, but leave us to question how much worse they can get.  
"Who knows what tomorrow brings, or takes away?"

*What will emerge?*

There is this wiki article on "Systems Theory" being the "interdisciplinary study of systems" and surely emergence is a property of that. But I feel like its one of those things that is so vague and general that its hard to say anything useful about the world with.

I often times feel like I get something more useful out of reading about something specific like game theory, information theory, chaos theory, signals, or just mathematics in general. I also feel like this is what most people in power do... Like the govt/NSA, in Information Operations and many  other departments. They're one of the 'organisms' that hires the most mathematicians, and surely not for no reason. Thats not even counting the companies and other organisms that they puppet... or puppet them...

I always wonder why people give so much of their power to an organism who's philosophy is secret or unknown to its labor force. Especially after Snowden, Wikileaks, + every other embarrassing events. How do you justify it? Copium? Are you groomed? Or is it the escape from your self?

This isn't necessarily a hit at the govt & company... Other people have other information and interpretations of the world and everyone is susceptible to brainwash :D

Anyways, just sharing quick thoughts here. Have a good day.
  
"O plunge your hands in water,  
&emsp;Plunge them up to the wrist;  
Stare, stare into the basin  
&emsp; And wonder what you've missed.
  
O look, look in the mirror,  
&emsp;O look in your distress:  
Life remains a blessing  
&emsp;Although you cannot bless.
  
O stand, stand at the window  
&emsp;As the tears scald and start;  
You shall love your crooked neighbour  
&emsp;With your crooked heart."
