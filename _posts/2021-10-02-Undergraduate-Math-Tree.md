When I was an undergrad at SUNY Fredonia I took an intro web dev course and for my final project I decided to make [this tree](https://mathtree.github.io/).<br><br>

The idea here was that I thought learning comes easier when you know what the hell you're trying to learn. I also understood that the courses are connected and related in some way, so I represented the courses names as nodes and the edges as 'relationship'. <br><br>

I think its kind of funny that I spent WAY more time on the random node colors than anything else. The source is there, but basically I had some sort of metric for colors, and then I would randomly select hex until I was "close enough". I think it actually turned out really well! Usually the colors come out pretty.
