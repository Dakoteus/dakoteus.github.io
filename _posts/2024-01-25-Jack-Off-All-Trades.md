Witty title... but for real. I just had some thoughts on this sort of character that I want to just write about.

Whenever I saw someone talking about "Jack of all trades" it was always either with good intent, like you're a polymath or something... or they were referencing "Jack of all trades, master of none".. which is 'bad'. In my opinion, which I will explain, even master of none has a bright side.

Obviously, the basic idea of this phrase is that nobody really has the time to become proficient in everything they seek to do. People don't just become proficient at things by dabbling (insert cringe Gladwell quote here). Being super ultra talented at everything is rare, duh.

One idea that sat with me was that it's really an issue (actually, not really?) when the trades are means of self expression. For example, I have worked relatively hard at math for ~6 years, music > 6 years, coding ~6 years, and then I have 'dabbled' in things like photography, chess, physics, and philosophy for numerous years. I feel the most confident in my coding skills and they're not even that great. Plus I don't do a lot of self expression with code, it's mostly just for work, but occasionally I have an excuse.. like this blog.

This is where people say "Jack of all trades, master of none" with negative connotation. I can't really express myself in any dimension the way I want to (maybe this just happens no matter how skillful you become, unless you are truly grand master?). Not only this, but I can't do it in x dimensions. Not in music, not in math, not in photography. So, obviously not being able to express my ideas after working so hard to try to seems like a failure. 

I think I'm writing this article to point out that there is another side to this.

For starters, there is absolutely no way I would see the world as I do if I did not study multiple disciplines. One of my favorite guitarists Peter Bernstein, and I'm sure many other musicians, say that jazz standards, or just good repertoire, is what ultimately teaches you about the music. Different tunes are for different things. The music teaches the music, crazy. It's just that when we're talking about life, the tunes are experience, ideas, concepts... etc. Life teaches life, basically.. and I just cannot sit by and ignore life. There should be an obligatory cybernetics mention here, so here it is.

Even if you don't like that premise though, there's still the fact that learning multiple disciplines probably keeps me interested in the disciplines I'm already interested in. Maybe if I wasn't so distracted in other things, exploring, connecting ideas.. I would just drop out of it all and lose interest. The easiest example is physics and math. Obviously, to most normal people that study math, applying your knowledge to physics and learning the current models is eye opening, addicting even. A slightly harder example is seeing relationships between "art and non-art", like art and math, or music and math, etc. I have whole other opinions on music and math and why I hate people, but that's a different article.

But wait, that's not all. You still have to admit that by not being a Jack of all trades, you're kind of letting yourself down if you're a widely curious person. You're explicitly giving up one abstract model for the next, so in the realm of explanation, really two different things are happening. Either you can explain certain phenomena really well, or you can explain a lot of phenomena to a certain point, and there is the trade off.

This trade off makes me believe it's not worth it, (((for me personally))), to be a master of one. Yet being equal in the trades doesn't satisfy me either. For the reason that I care about some things more than others. I care about the model of the universe more than the model of how clothes work, just personally.

So I think basically Jack has to answer to two dilemmas:

1.) What are the important models?

2.) How should you go about creating/growing them?

Recently I've been trying to figure these two things out and I've been making some progress. I feel like I've been answering the harder non-googlable questions that I ask myself with a higher degree of certainty. I have a new method of tackling a certain recurring problem that has been very useful in the past few weeks. I'm going to sit on it for a while and let it ruin my life for a little bit.

ciao
